# Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose: 

The client, Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to their customers. Before offering this new service, the company has requested a review of cryptocurrencies currently trading on the market and how each could be grouped as a means for creating a classification system for the new investment. 

## Method: 
The dataset used for this review will need to be fit for machine learning, using unsupervised learning models. Using Principal Components (PCA) and K-Means models, the data was classed into groups and plotted in a 3-D Scatter Display. 

Based on the algorithm results of an Elbow Curve plot, the four clusters were determined. The highest concentration of results are in class 1.

## Results: 

The report indicates four-clusters of cryptocurrency. Using the data included in the report, Accountability Accounting is able to establish currency to include in each class based on Total Coins Mined and Total Coin Supply.

The image below shows the clusters by class. Class zero has the highest density of clustering. Class one appears as an outlier in this report. Classes two and three have some concentrations of coin mined and supply.

This information will help the bank gain insight into adding cryptocurrency services for their customers.
